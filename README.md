- Hi, I’m Shohruz Ernazarov, a 16-year old high school student and an aspiring Software Engineer. 
-  I’m interested in anything really, as long as it is something new for me to learn or benefit from. 
-  I’m currently learning the fundamentals of python, and plan on learning SQL after, and then Java and/or Javascript, as well as the relevant frameworks.  
-  I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of different projects, anything that can provide a new learning experience. 
-  You can reach me by emailing me via shohruz123456789@gmail.com
