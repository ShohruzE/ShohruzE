- Hi, I’m Shohruz Ernazarov, a 17-year old high school student and an aspiring Software Engineer. 
-  I’m interested in anything really, as long as it is something new for me to learn or benefit from. 
-  I’m currently learning Java, and plan on learning Python after. 
-  I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of different projects, anything that can provide a new learning experience. 
-  You can reach me by emailing me via shohruzernazarov04@gmail.com
